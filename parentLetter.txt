RE: CHILD NAME

Dear Parent/Guardian,

I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to Early Intervention. Every family involved in Early Intervention is assigned a service coordinator to provide assistance. Your service coordinator is:

SERVICE COORDINATOR NAME

Your service coordinator will be contacting you to set up an appointment to tell you about the Early Intervention program and obtain some information from you about your child. Please read the enclosed information which tells you about Early Intervention and insurance. When your service coordinator makes the first visit, you can help this process go more quickly by:

having insurance card(s) available
Filling out the insurance form that is enclosed

If you cannot fill out the insurance form ahead of time, please have the information ready for your service coordinator.

Please help your child by letting your service coordinator know anytime that you cannot keep a scheduled Early Interview appointment. We appreciate your cooperation, as we only have 45 days from the referral date to begin services if your child qualifies.

*Please note that if your child is eligible for Early Intervention, there is a shortage of providers and a waitlist for children who qualify for services. Please be patient with your service coordinator. He/she will notify you when your child has been assigned to a therapist. There is also the possibility that a provider may discon tinue employment at any time at which time your child will be put back on the needs list; we cannot guarantee that he/she will be assigned to a new provider immediately.

If you have any questions, please call your service coordinator at PHONE NUMBER EXT: EXT#
Sincerely,
Jenny Dickinson, MPA
Director, Special Children Services
Onondaga County Health Department
